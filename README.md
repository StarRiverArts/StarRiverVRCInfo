# VRChat WorldInfo by StarRiver

This repository contains two separate toolsets:

## Racing Club
Utilities that download racing records from a Google Spreadsheet and
build text or HTML leaderboards. See [`Racing Club/README.md`](Racing%20Club/README.md)
for full usage instructions.

## VRChat World Info
A workflow for collecting VRChat world information and approving entries.
It exports a JSON file for use on a website or inside Unity and includes a
simple Tkinter interface for reviewing worlds.
